This video is my first tutorial where I will show how to setup ReactJs and Bootstrap 4, there is few ways, but I think this is the easiest.

- Creating a new React app with create-react-app.
* Before this step you will need to have installed node on your local development machine *

- Implementing Bootstrap framework adding CSS and JS files
* In this case I'm using latest version of Bootstrap 4.1.3*
