Hello friends and strangers,

Welcome to my personal blog.

Here I will document my way of learning and some other challenges that may be useful and interesting to the community with interest in web development and programming in general.
Considering that English is not my native language, my goal is to write actively, at least twice a week.

I'm very excited and I hope you will be a fellow traveler on this journey. 

Wish me a luck!
